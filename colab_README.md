### Key Features of the Google Colab Setup Script:

1. **Environment Verification**:
   - Checks Python version and confirms you're in a Colab environment
   - Detects if a GPU is available (Colab often provides NVIDIA GPUs)

2. **Google Drive Integration** (Optional):
   - Provides code to mount your Google Drive for persistent storage
   - Creates a project directory that persists between sessions

3. **Package Installation**:
   - Installs and verifies PyTorch with the appropriate GPU/CPU configuration
   - Adds required packages (openai, numpy, pandas)
   - Sets up Hugging Face Transformers

4. **Repository Setup**:
   - Clones the FairCoder repository from GitHub
   - Checks if the repository already exists and pulls latest changes if needed

5. **Optional Components**:
   - Hugging Face login for accessing gated models
   - OpenAI API setup with secure key input
   - Testing access to gated models mentioned in the instructions

### How to Use This Notebook:

1. Upload the notebook to Google Colab (or open directly from your Google Drive)
2. Run each cell sequentially using the play buttons
3. For optional cells (like Hugging Face login or OpenAI API setup), uncomment the code first
4. The notebook includes clear markdown explanations for each section

This approach is particularly useful because Google Colab:
- Provides free GPU access
- Has most data science packages pre-installed
- Offers persistent storage through Google Drive
- Doesn't require local installation of complex dependencies

Remember that Colab sessions are temporary, so you'll need to run this setup script each time you start a new session, unless you save your work to Google Drive.
