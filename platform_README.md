Both scripts follow the same general workflow:

1. **Environment Checks**: Verifies the operating system and necessary prerequisites
2. **Python Setup**: Checks for Python installation and installs it if not found
3. **Virtual Environment**: Creates and activates a Python virtual environment
4. **GPU Detection**: Checks for NVIDIA GPU availability for appropriate PyTorch installation
5. **Package Installation**: Installs PyTorch, required Python packages, and Hugging Face Transformers
6. **Git Setup**: Verifies Git installation and helps with repository setup
7. **Final Verification**: Confirms that all components are installed correctly

### How to use these scripts:

#### On Windows:
1. Save the PowerShell script as `setup_environment.ps1`
2. Open PowerShell and navigate to the directory containing the script
3. Run: `.\setup_environment.ps1`

#### On Unix (Linux/macOS):
1. Save the Bash script as `setup_environment.sh`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x setup_environment.sh`
3. Run: `./setup_environment.sh`

The scripts include interactive prompts for GitHub setup and provide detailed feedback throughout the process. They also handle different Linux distributions and package managers for Unix-based systems.
